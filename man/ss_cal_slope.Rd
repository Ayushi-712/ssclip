\title{Minimum sample size for external validation of a clinical prediction model with a continuous outcome}
\usage{
ss_cal_slope(R2, lambda, width, alpha)
}
\arguments{
\item{R2}{Expected coefficient of determination (R2) of the calibration model}

\item{lambda}{Anticipated (mis)calibration across the range of predicted values}

\item{width}{Width of confidence interval of lambda}

\item{alpha}{Level of Significance}
}
\value{
A html file contains minimum sample size
}
\description{
Precise estimate of calibration slope
}
\examples{

#Eg. Sample size to target a 95\% confidence interval for 𝜆cal
#that has a narrow width ≤ 0.2 (eg, if the calibration slope was 1,
# the confidence interval would be 0.9 to 1.1 assuming confidence
#intervals derived by 𝜆̂cal ± 1.96SE𝜆̂cal) and assuming R2val = 0.5 .
ss_cal_slope( R2= 0.5,width = 0.2,alpha = 0.05, lambda = 1)

#for different combinations of parameters
ss_cal_slope( R2= c(0.7,0.8),width =c( 1.1,1.2),alpha = 0.05, lambda = 1)
